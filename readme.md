# map-arr [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukeed/map-arr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukeed/map-arr)

> A tiny (124b), faster alternative to native `Array.prototype.map`!

## MOVED!

My motivation for faster-than-native `Array.prototype`s continued! This module is part of the bunch.

Although the collection is still actively WIP, you may go [here](https://github.com/lukeed/arr) for further updates.

This repository will not be updated or maintained.

...Still here?! You should _really_ go to the collection :point_up:
